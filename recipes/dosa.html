    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Wheat dosa. Serve with coconut chutney, sambar, or some other Indian curry.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch baking soda</li>
        <li>1¾ cups water (or more as needed)</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil (for cooking)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Combine flour, 2 tablespoons oil, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Mix for 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 3/4 cup water and mix until it's lump free, the chunks of flour have dissolved, and the batter has a good consistency, adding more water if needed.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil on a griddle over medium heat. Pour some of the batter onto the griddle; spread the batter in a circular motion, slowly yet steadily. Cook until the edges start to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the grill. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil between each batch. </li>
    </ol>
